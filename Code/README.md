##  2 - Getting Started:

The objective of this assignment is to develop a reconstruction autoencoder to perform anomaly detection and localization on the CIFAR-10 data set. The CIFAR-10 data set was segmented into a training-validation-testing. Two distinct model architectures were trained for the given autoencoder, as hyperparameter tuning occurred in both Model 1 and Model 2 Python notebooks in order to deduce what the optimal parameters were for the given model architecture. The resulting ROC curves, and pixel-level images from both Python notebooks are presented throughout our paper.
